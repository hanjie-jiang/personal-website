<div class="timeline-title">The Curator Agent</div>
<div class="timeline-subtitle">A Deterministic Cognitive Pipeline for AI Research Curation</div>
<div class="timeline-content">

- Architected a modular Level 1 Agent with deterministic cognitive pipelines to autonomously track, score, and deduplicate daily AI research papers from Hugging Face, reducing manual research time from 2 hours to 3 minutes.
- Implemented three high-cohesion modules: **PerceptionTools** (robust API ingestion), **CognitiveBrain** (Qwen-2.5-14B inference with dual-stage Scientist/Critic reasoning), and **PaperArchive** (vector-based semantic deduplication).
- Optimized for resource efficiency on AWS Graviton ARM64 CPU clusters using bfloat16 precision.
- Engineered circuit breaker logic and Pydantic guardrails to transform probabilistic LLM outputs into deterministic structured data.
