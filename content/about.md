Hi there! Welcome to my website.

I am currently a Machine Learning Scientist at the Expedia Group, working on Product Pricing and Monetization. I used to be a graduate student in scientific computing and computational quantum chemistry program at the University of Michigan.

I enjoy solving problems in all fields using modeling approaches and coding languages. Therefore, I am particularly interested in data applications to our daily lives.

I am strongly motivated in researching and analyzing data. More importantly, I LOVE learning about new things and exploring the data world. I am also a fast-paced worker.

Really nice to have you here!
